## Running the Project

This project is set up using Vite. To run it locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

**Note:** Do not open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. You must use the `npm run dev` command to start the Vite development server.
